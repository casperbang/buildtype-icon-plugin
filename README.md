# Buildtype icon plugin - for Android

## Introduction
This plugin for Android projects aims at providing a mechanism for generating launcher icons for non-release builds - as an alternative to having to provide these manually. 

All too often, intermediate build types (test, beta, preview, staging, develop etc.) aren't given a dedicated icon to tell them apart from a production release, either because the developer can't be bothered or because there is no time (read: money) for doing so. The buildtype-icon-plugin will go through all variants and add a dedicated icon, based on the release variant, and do some image processing and add a label.

##Examples
The examples below are purely for illustrative purposes, please don't sue me because I overlayed text onto your companys logo. ;)
